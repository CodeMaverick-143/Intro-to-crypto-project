    <h1>What is Crypto Mining?</h1>
    <p>
        Crypto mining, or cryptocurrency mining, is the process of validating and verifying transactions on a blockchain network. It involves solving complex mathematical problems to add new blocks of transactions to the blockchain. In return, miners are rewarded with cryptocurrency tokens.
    </p>
    
    <h2>Key Concepts in Crypto Mining</h2>
    <h3>Purpose</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>To maintain the integrity and security of a blockchain network by verifying transactions.</li>
        <li>To introduce new cryptocurrency into circulation (in some cases).</li>
    </ul>
    <img src="images/crypto_mine_img.jpg" />
    <h3>How It Works</h3>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Transaction Validation</strong>: Transactions are grouped into a "block."</li>
        <li><strong>Mathematical Problem-Solving</strong>: Miners solve a cryptographic puzzle to validate this block.</li>
        <li><strong>Proof of Work (PoW)</strong>: The first miner to solve the problem adds the block to the blockchain and earns a reward.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>Note: Some systems use alternative methods like <strong>Proof of Stake (PoS)</strong>, which relies on staking instead of mining.</p>

    <h3>Rewards</h3>
    <p>Miners receive cryptocurrency as an incentive for their work (e.g., Bitcoin miners earn BTC).</p>

    <h3>Mining Equipment</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>ASICs (Application-Specific Integrated Circuits)</strong>: Specialized hardware for mining.</li>
        <li><strong>GPUs (Graphics Processing Units)</strong>: Used for mining Ethereum or other altcoins.</li>
        <li><strong>CPUs (Central Processing Units)</strong>: Less commonly used due to lower efficiency.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Energy Consumption</h3>
    <p>Mining can be energy-intensive, especially for popular cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, as it requires a lot of computational power.</p>

    <h3>Decentralization</h3>
    <p>Mining is decentralized, meaning no single authority controls the network. It relies on miners worldwide to maintain the system.</p>

    <h2>Why People Mine Cryptocurrency</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Profitability</strong>: Miners earn rewards, which can be profitable if the value of the cryptocurrency exceeds the cost of mining.</li>
        <li><strong>Support the Network</strong>: By mining, individuals help secure the blockchain network and validate transactions.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Challenges in Crypto Mining</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>High Energy Costs</strong>: Mining consumes significant electricity.</li>
        <li><strong>Equipment Costs</strong>: Mining rigs can be expensive.</li>
        <li><strong>Difficulty Adjustments</strong>: As more miners join, the problems become harder to solve.</li>
        <li><strong>Environmental Concerns</strong>: The energy consumption has raised concerns about the environmental impact of mining.</li>
    </ul>


    <h2>What is Blockchain Technology?</h2>
    <h2>Definition</h2>
    <p>
        Blockchain is a shared, immutable ledger that records transactions and tracks assets across a business network.
    </p>
    
    <h2>Purpose</h2>
    <p>
        Tracks anything of value, making transactions secure and transparent.
    </p>

    <h2>Nature</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>It is a distributed database shared across a computer network.</li>
        <li>Uses digital formats to store information securely.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Core Concept</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Operates as Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT).</li>
        <li>Converts currencies and assets into digital formats and stores them securely.</li>
        <li>Works via connected data blocks, ensuring they are tamper-proof.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>How Blockchain Works</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Data is stored in linked blocks.</li>
        <li>Once added, data cannot be changed, deleted, or destroyed.</li>
        <li>Each block connects to the previous one, forming a secure chain.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Key Applications</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>First introduced in 1991 as a research project.</li>
        <li>Gained prominence in 2009 with the advent of Bitcoin.</li>
        <li>Applications include:
            <ul>
                <li>Cryptocurrencies.</li>
                <li>Decentralized finance (DeFi) applications.</li>
                <li>Non-fungible tokens (NFTs).</li>
                <li>Smart contracts.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Features of Blockchain</h2>
    <h3>Decentralized</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>No governing authority; maintained by a network of nodes.</li>
        <li>Users can directly access and store their assets without intermediaries.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Immutability</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Data cannot be altered or deleted once added.</li>
        <li>Promotes transparency and makes it corruption-proof.</li>
        <li>Majority of nodes must validate transactions for addition to the ledger.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Enhanced Security</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Uses cryptographic hashing to secure information.</li>
        <li>Tampering with one block would require altering all blocks across the network.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Distributed Ledger</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>All participants share a synchronized copy of the ledger.</li>
        <li>Any suspicious activity is easily detected and prevented.</li>
        <li>Nodes act as verifiers for adding transactions.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Consensus Mechanisms</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Decision-making is achieved through consensus algorithms.</li>
        <li>Ensures agreement among nodes for validating transactions.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Types of Blockchain</h2>
    <h3>Public Blockchain</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Non-restrictive and permission-less.</li>
        <li>Any user can access records, validate transactions, or perform mining.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Private Blockchain</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Restrictive and permission-based.</li>
        <li>Operates within a closed network (e.g., organizations).</li>
        <li>Controlled by an organization with specific security and access levels.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Consortium Blockchain</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Semi-decentralized.</li>
        <li>Managed by multiple organizations that act as nodes.</li>
        <li>Suitable for collaborative networks between businesses.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Hybrid Blockchain</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Combines features of public and private blockchains.</li>
        <li>Allows selective public access while keeping sensitive data private.</li>
        <li>Flexible and adaptable for specific use cases.</li>
    </ul>
